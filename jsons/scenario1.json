-  selected_element : it is the element number , which the user is proposing. so for each iteration it should be updtaed.
-  system_report : it is the outcome of each simulation iteration: it has two main situations: 1. confirmation 2. collapsing : asking for selecting another element or supporting. 
   system_report also shoulde be updated for each element simulation.
-   system_memory: it is the one working with memory of structural agent. it stores the successful reults of all iterations . so in each iteration we add, not update, the result to the system_memory

# scenario: first we remove element1, element0, and element2.
